* LP-Programming CPPM
This is the reusable / portable portions of C++ 26 modules I use. Anything that isn't entirely application specific
lives here.

** Literate
The literate branch has some org-mode files that have extra documentation about some of the modules which live here. I
don't awlays create them, and don't clutter the master branch with them, but any changes to those modules go through the
org file, so they /should/ always be up to date.
